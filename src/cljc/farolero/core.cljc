  The handler-fn is a function of at least one argument. The first argument is
  the condition which was signaled, additional arguments are passed from the
  rest arguments used when signaling.

  The thread-local configuration for a handler specifies whether or not other
  threads are allowed to invoke this handler. It defaults to false. If the
  handler performs any kind of non-local return, such as calling a restart that
  performs non-local return, signaling an error that might be handled with a
  non-local return, or calling to [[return-from]] or [[go]], it should be set to
  true.

(defmacro restart-bind
  "Runs the `body` with bound restarts.
  Within the dynamic scope of the `body`, [[invoke-restart]] may be called with
  any of the bound restart names. This includes inside handlers bound further up
  the stack.

  Each binding clause is one of the following forms:
  restart-name restart-fn
  restart-name [restart-fn & {:keys [test-function interactive-function report-function thread-local]}]

  The restart-name is a namespaced keyword.

  The restart-fn is a function of zero or more arguments, provided by rest
  arguments on the call to [[invoke-restart]]. The function returns normally.

  The test-function is a function of an optional condition and its additional
  arguments. If it returns a truthy value, the restart is available, otherwise
  it cannot be invoked from its context. If not provided, the restart is assumed
  to be available.

  The report-function is a function or string used to display this condition to
  the user. If it is a function, it is called with the restart as an argument
  and should return a string. The restart will be a map with the key
  `:farolero.core/restart-name`. If report-function is a string, it is used
  verbatim.

  The boolean thread-local tells the system whether or not this restart may be
  invoked from other threads. It defaults to false. If the restart performs any
  kind of non-local return that cares about which thread performs it, such as a
  call to [[return-from]] or [[go]], signaling a condition which may cause a
  non-local return, or invoking a restart which may perform a non-local return,
  it should set it to true.

  The interactive-function is a function of no arguments that is called to get
  input from the user interactively. It returns a list, used as the argument
  list to restart-fn."

  "Checks to see if the value stored in `place` conforms to `spec`.
  `place` must evaluate to an implementation of IDeref. Raises a
  `:farolero.core/type-error` if it does not conform. Binds a
  `:farolero.core/store-value` restart taking a function to modify `place` and a
  value to use as its second argument. Also binds `:farolero.core/continue` to
  retry check.

  If the `:farolero.core/store-value` restart is invoked interactively, it will
  signal `:farolero.core/interactive-check-type`, passing the form for `place`,
  binding a further `:farolero.core/store-value` restart which expects the
  modify function and argument for passing to the outer restart."
